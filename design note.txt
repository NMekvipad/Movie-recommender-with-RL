Code from original paper do a single pass on small graph, but my graph is so large so the whole graph cannot be passed through the network in one go.

This means I cannot reuse that the way trainig loop is constructed used in original paper (single pass for whole graph for each layer), and I need to do data sampling.

However, given MAGNN architecture that I want to try, normal sampling technique available in PyTorch Geometric library won't work on metapath graph that original paper use as 
the sampling technique won't take into account nodes on metapath edges.

Thus, it means that sampling need to be done at Hetero graph level or at metapath graph level but implement sampling in such a way that it takes nodes on metapath edges into account.
